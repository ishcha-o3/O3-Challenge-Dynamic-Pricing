# Freight Rate Dynamic Pricing Dashboard

We are building an interactive dashboard for freight rate dynamic pricing.
Our model consists of collecting external data and historical data combined with mathematical modeling and is built in Knime (open-source data analytics platform).
After data collection, preparation, and analysis, the optimum dynamic rates are calculated for each shipping route and load type (e.g. container 20, 40, 40HC, and 45HC) for the coming week.
Currently, Singapore to Europe (7 ports) and vise versa are included in the model.
